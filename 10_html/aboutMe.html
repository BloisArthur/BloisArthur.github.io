    <div class="introduction">
        <p>I’m a second-year student in the BUT Networking and Telecommunications program. I’m 18 years old and live in
            Riom, in the Puy-de-Dôme department (63), France. <br><br> It was during my final year of high school that I became interested in computer science, thanks to the NSI
            course (Digital and Computer Science). That’s when I also got my first introduction to networking.</p>

        <p>However, it was through discovering the university-level Networking and Telecommunications program that I was
            able to explore what I truly enjoy: computer networks. In my opinion, this is a field that continues to grow
            and evolve in today’s world. That’s why I chose to study at IUT Clermont Auvergne.</p>
