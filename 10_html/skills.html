                <p><b>Teamwork makes dream work</b><br>
                    Having played several team sports, including handball for five years, I developed a strong sense of
                    teamwork. This proved very useful during my BAFA practical training, where I had to organise various
                    activities in collaboration with youth leaders who were often older and more experienced than I.</p>

                <p><b>Forebearance</b><br>
                    At all times during my BAFA vocational training I took care of disabled children, especially one
                    that
                    had
                    Down syndrome. This made me realise that he had specific needs, and I had to learn to accommodate
                    those
                    while still integrating him into the social group.</p>

                <h4>Networking</h4>
                <h5>Configuration of a network</h5>
                <p>
                    During classes I learned how to set up various machines and services. Firstly using
                    <span class="monospace-text">Cisco Packet Tracer</span>. In other classes, I learned how to set up
                    and configure Wi-Fi hotspots in order to study frame exchanges using tools like
                    <span class="monospace-text">Wireshark</span> and <span class="monospace-text">Scrapy</span>.
                </p>

                <h5>Installation of virtual machines</h5>
                <p>I learned in classes how to set up virtual machines under Windows and Linux as well as connect them
                    to the Uni network and the internet</p>

                <h4>Coding</h4>
                <h5>Basic knowledge of Linux commands & scripts</h5>
                <p>I've learned how interact with the Linux terminal, how to use commands and how to write scripts to
                    automate tasks. In class, we were mostly dealing with files and small automations</p>

                <h5>Python coding</h5>
                <p>During Highschool, I've acquiered solid foundations of the python language thanks to the computer
                    science classes</p>

                <h5>Web development</h5>
                <p>Starting in Highschool and during the first weeks of the freshman year, I've learned the basis of
                    <span class="monospace-text">HTML</span> & <span class="monospace-text">CSS</span>. I'm teaching
                    myself some <span class="monospace-text">JavaScript</span> to make this website even more attracting
                </p>

                <h4>Telecommunications</h4>
                <h5>Creation and analysis of one or many signals</h5>
                <p>During hands-on practice in class I'm learning how to create one or several signals using frequence
                    generators. The goal is to mesure the frequencies and amplitudes of said signals</p>
