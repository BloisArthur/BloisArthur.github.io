            <b>Teamwork makes dream work</b><br>
            Having played several team sports, including handball for five years, I developed a strong sense of teamwork.
            This proved very usefull during my BAFA practical training, where I had to organise various activities in collaboration with youth leader who were often older and more experienced than I.
