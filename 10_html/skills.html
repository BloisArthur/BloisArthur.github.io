            <p><b>Teamwork makes dream work</b><br>
                Having played several team sports, including handball for five years, I developed a strong sense of
                teamwork. This proved very useful during my BAFA practical training, where I had to organise various
                activities in collaboration with youth leaders who were often older and more experienced than I.</p>

        <div class="forebearance">
            <p><b>Forebearance</b><br>
                At all times during my BAFA vocational training I took care of disabled children, especially one that
                had
                Down syndrome. This made me realise that he had specific needs, and I had to learn to accommodate those
                while still integrating him into the social group.</p>
