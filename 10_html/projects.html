                <h3>Telephony lab</h3>

                <p><b>Context:</b><br>
                    As part of the telephony lab, I learned how to setup a call server with the help of a classmate over
                    the course of three 2 hours sessions.</p>

                <p><b>Goal:</b><br>
                    A classmate and I had to follow the instructions provided in the lab manual, while also relying on
                    the documentation made available by the IUT.</p>

                <p><b>The work itself:</b><br>
                    First, we connected to and reset a call server in order to create a subscriber for each phone: two
                    TFA clients and two SIP clients. We also learned how to install and configure a softphone. Then, we
                    created a SIP trunk with our ITSP Hexatel to establish communication outside our local telephony
                    network.
                    We then created groups to automatically forward calls from one phone to another, and we configured
                    voicemail on our phones as well as the MyPortal tool on Windows.
                    Finally, we learned how a call server can interact with a corporate messaging system (notably via
                    the call server’s “mail” service), and how to integrate a mobile phone into our local network so it
                    can be reached both via a desk phone and a mobile device.
                    I personally worked on creating the subscribers and the SIP trunk, as well as configuring the
                    voicemail and mail service.</p>

                <p><b>Mark:</b>
                    I received a score of 16.75/20 for this graded lab at the end of the semester.</p>

                <h3>SAE 15 - data treatment</h3>

                <p><b>Goal:</b><br>
                    I had to make a python script to retreive a <span class="monospace-text">.csv</span> file in which
                    my timetable is stored. The script then calculate the number of hour of hands-on practice, classes
                    and amphitheatre for each subject.
                </p>

                <p><b>The work itself:</b><br>
                    Firstly I had to export my timetable to use the script provided by my professor to convert it to a
                    <span class="monospace-text">.csv</span> file. Then I used the <span
                        class="monospace-text">pandas</span>
                    librairy in <span class="monospace-text">Python</span>.
                    This librairy allowed me to create tables in <span class="monospace-text">Python</span> with the
                    different classes and their time periode. There was also the groups that must participate in those
                    classes and the type of teaching.

                <h3>NSI projects 2024</h3>

                <p><b>Context:</b><br>
                    Together with two friends, I had to create a project in Python to participate in the "Les Trophées
                    NSI" competition.</p>

                <p><b>Goal</b><br>
                    Our goal was to recreate, in Python, the board game Simon. The objective of this game is to memorize
                    and
                    then repeat a sequence of randomly chosen colors. We submitted this project to the Trophées NSI
                    competition.</p>

                <p><b>The work itself:</b><br>
                    We created a solo mode where the player plays alone with the aim of scoring as many points as
                    possible. A score counter was displayed and increased by 1 each time the player successfully
                    repeated a color sequence. Our program randomly selected a color from blue, red, green, and yellow,
                    and added it to a queue that held all previously chosen colors.
                    We also developed a full graphical interface with menus to select the game mode, adjust settings
                    like music volume, and display the color sequence to be repeated, along with colored buttons the
                    player had to click to repeat the sequence.
                    We also aimed to implement a local multiplayer mode. Although this mode was nearly complete, we
                    didn’t have enough time to fully finish it before the competition, so it was still buggy. We
                    intended to set up a way to locally host a server that all players could connect to, as long as they
                    were on the same network.
                    I personally worked on the code for the color buttons and the sequence generation, as well as the
                    entire multiplayer feature.</p>

                <p><b>Result obtain:</b><br>
                    Unfortunately, we did not pass the selection rounds, and so we were not able to present our project
                    in person at the competition in Paris.</p>
