                <h3>SAE 15 - data treatment</h3>

                <p><b>Goal:</b><br>
                    I had to make a python script to retreive a <span class="monospace-text">.csv</span> file in which
                    my timetable is stored. The script then calculate the number of hour of hands-on practice, classes
                    and amphitheatre for each subject.
                </p>

                <p><b>The work itself:</b><br>
                    Firstly I had to export my timetable to use the script provided by my professor to convert it to a
                    <span class="monospace-text">.csv</span> file. Then I used the <span
                        class="monospace-text">pandas</span>
                    librairy in <span class="monospace-text">Python</span>.
                    This librairy allowed me to create tables in <span class="monospace-text">Python</span> with the
                    different classes and their time periode. There was also the groups that must participate in those
                    classes and the type of teaching.
