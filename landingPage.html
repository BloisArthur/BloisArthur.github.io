            <h3>BAFA vocational traininng - July 31 to August 18 2023</h3>
            <p>I completed my BAFA (Certificate of Aptitude for Youth Work) in a leisure center in the town of Riom. I spent three weeks as a trainee youth leader.<br>
            During this time, I was responsable for a groupe of 2-4-years-olds, followed by a group of 7-8-years-olds, working alongside two qualified youth workers.<br>
            This experience allowed me to develop my teamwork skills in order to collaborate effectively with my colleagues, and it also stenghtened my patience, as I had to understand and respond appropriately to the various needs of the children.</p>
