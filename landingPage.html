                    I followed the "Générale" path throughout high school.<br />
                    From the second year onward, I took classes in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and
                    Chemistry.<br />
                    In my final year, I focused on Mathematics and Computer Science, dropping Physics and
                    Chemistry.<br />
                    I graduated from high school with honors.

                <h3>BAFA Vocational Training — July 31 to August 18, 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    I completed my BAFA vocational training (Certificate of Aptitude for Youth Work) in a leisure center
                    in the town of Riom. I spent three weeks as a trainee youth leader.<br />
                    During this time, I was responsible for a group of 2–4-year-olds, followed by a group of
                    7–8-year-olds, working alongside two qualified youth workers.<br />
                    This experience allowed me to develop my teamwork skills to collaborate effectively with my
                    colleagues. It also strengthened my patience, as I had to understand and respond appropriately to
                    the various needs of the children.

                <h3>Corn Detasseling — June 14 to June 25, 2021</h3>
                <p>
                    I took part in corn detasseling during the summer of 2021. This experience allowed me to discover
                    the world of work and to develop my teamwork skills by collaborating with farmers to ensure the
                    quality and productivity of their harvests. It especially helped me strengthen my team spirit.
